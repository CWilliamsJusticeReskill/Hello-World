# Hello-World
My second try
I started using Github over a month ago.  I ended up jumping around so much, just trying to learn which coding language to learn first.  I learned a little about everything to do with coding apps, Interfaces, IDE'S, and Text Editors.  I could have kept going down a rabbit hole to nowhere, then my Instructor Aaron said, "Focus on"....    And now I am back at Github to give this Hello World a go round one more time.  LOL
